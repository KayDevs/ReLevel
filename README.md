Keller's Personal Game/Engine

This is an Game or Game Engine being developed by me, Keller, for personal use.
I am just programming right now to get a handle on SFML and game design in general, 
so this may or may not turn into a complete game.
Either way, it'll be a fun learning experience for me.

This is being developed in Visual Studio 2012, 
however:
it does not use any Microsoft specific coding practices, libraries, or standard functions.
I intend on porting this to multiple platforms in the future, so any OS-specific code is undesireable.
